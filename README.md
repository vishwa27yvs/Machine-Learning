Machine Learning in Python

#Handwritten Digit Recognition:- 
To recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST data set, using keras from TensorFlow. I have used a sequential neural network layer with 3 layers. Optimizer used is Stochastic Gradient Descent(SGD) along with sparse categorical cross entropy for loss function. This gives an accuracy of 0.9778.

#Movie Recommendation system:- 
To recommend movies on the basis of ratings. Used K-NearestNeighbors from sklearn. The metric that is used here is cosine. The ratings for movies is present in the data folder of the repo.

#Credit Card Fraud Detection:- 
Uses gaussian naive bayes model to detect fraud detection in credit card transaction. Uses confusion Matrix to evaluate the classification of the model. In weighted average precision is 1.0, recall is 0.99 and f1-score is 0.99. Data is present in data.csv
